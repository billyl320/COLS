# COLS Created Regular Polygon Experiment
Code for experiment regarding CVPR paper called "Classification using Ordinary Least Squares Improves Overall Accuracy and Interpretability for Small Data Problems" for the created regular polygons. The EIs resulting from the image operators are from Lamberti, Kinser, and Eagle (2019).  The corresponding paper has the code to create the images as well. Please cite Lamberti, Kinser, and Eagle (2019) as some of the results come directly from that paper.
