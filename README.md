# COLS Simulated Multivariate Normal Experiment

Code for experiments regarding CVPR paper called "Classification using Ordinary Least Squares Improves Overall Accuracy and Interpretability for Small Data Problems" for simulated multivariate normal data experiment.  This experiment shows that COLS is applicable to problems outside of image data.
